# Client - Configure request

A sample Ktor project showing how to configure a [request URL and parameters](https://ktor.io/docs/request.html). This sample uses the [Logging](https://ktor.io/docs/client-logging.html) plugin to show the requested URLs in a console. You can change the logging level to `LogLevel.HEADERS` to see headers and cookies sent in a request.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

To run this sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:

```bash
./gradlew :client-configure-request:run
```
