# Request validation

A sample Ktor project showing how to validate a body of the incoming request using the `RequestValidation` plugin.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

To run a sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :request-validation:run
```

Then, open the [post.http](post.http) file and make test `POST` requests to check how request validation works.
