# Logging/Call logging

A sample Ktor project showing how to enable [Logging](https://ktor.io/docs/logging.html) in Ktor and use the [CallLogging](https://ktor.io/docs/call-logging.html) plugin to log incoming client requests.
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running

To run a sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :logging:run
```
Then, open the [http://localhost:8080/api/v1](http://localhost:8080/api/v1) page and return to the console to see a customized log message.
