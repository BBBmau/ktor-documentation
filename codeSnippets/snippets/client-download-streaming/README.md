# Client streaming download

A sample Ktor project showing how to download a file by using a streaming [response](https://ktor.io/docs/response.html). 

## Running

To run this sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./gradlew :client-download-streaming:run

# Windows
.\gradlew.bat :client-download-streaming:run

A client will save a file in a default temporary-file directory.
