# Form authentication

A sample project demonstrating how to use [form HTTP authentication](https://ktor.io/docs/form.html) in Ktor. In this sample, an HTML form is built using [HTML DSL](https://ktor.io/docs/html-dsl.html).
> This sample is a part of the [codeSnippets](../../README.md) Gradle project.

## Running
To run this sample, execute the following command in a repository's root directory:
```bash
./gradlew :auth-form-html-dsl:run
```

Then, open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and enter the `jetbrains`/`foobar` credentials in a login page to see a greeting. 
> You can also send credentials using the [HTTP client](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-in-product-code-editor.html). Open the [post.http](post.http) file and make a post request with credentials.
